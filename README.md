# cwten-Team-Profile-Generator
A project to generate team profile using node.js and object oriented programming. 
## Description
This application provides a more efficient way to generate a team of employees. It was challenging to link different html and js together. I learnt how to use htmlbuilder to present my ouput in an html format. I also learnt how to test for classes.

## Installation
The user needs to download the code for the app or clone the code from my repository https://github.com/Vickyb94/cwten-profile-generator

## Usage
The user launches the application on vscode and opens the terminal. The app will be initiated by entering "node index.js" on the command line. The options are followed and the user inputs the relevant information. The option "team is full" triggers Team created alert and the output is saved. The team page can be viewed through the browser
